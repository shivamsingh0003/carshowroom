# 🚗 Car Showroom Management System

Welcome to the **Car Showroom Management System** — a simple, console-based Java project designed to simulate the operations of a real-world car showroom.

This project was built to demonstrate object-oriented programming in action, focusing on how different entities like cars, customers, and showroom operations interact.
